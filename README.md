### Methods

##### `fuzz` (<object: `fixture`>, <function: `template`>)

Returns: EventEmitter

Repeatedly fuzzes the input fixture, replacing its leaves with various datatypes,
and then iteratively removing them â€” and running the template function each time
against it.

When it fails, it emits a `renderFailed` event.

The full list of events emitted are below.

### Events

*	`startingIteration` <number: `iteration`>
	Emitted when commencing a fuzzing iteration.
*	`transformingLeaves` <string: `fuzzerName`>
	Emitted with each fuzzer when transforming the leaf nodes in the object.
*	`testingRendering` <string: `fuzzerName`>
	Emitted with each fuzzer when attempting to render the template against the
	transformed fixture.
*	`testingRenderingOK` <string: `fuzzerName`>
	Emitted with each fuzzer when rendering the template against the fixture did
	not result in an error (TypeError and or otherwise.)
*	`renderFailed` <string: `errorMessage`>
	Emitted with an error message when rendering the template against the fixture
	resulted in an error.
*	`complete` array:[<string: `failureMessage`>...]
	Emitted once the fuzzing operation has concluded (the fixture has no remaining
	properties) with a list of error messages (if any) for all the template render
	failures captured over this time.

## Notes
